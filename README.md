# Spatialstructure_Analyses

Edges contain information that are behaviorally relevant. Some cells in area V1 of primate V1 encode information about edges. 
We, as in the visual neuroscience community, know about how luminance edges are encoded. How chromatic edges are encoded is poorly understood.

I investigated how is the encoding of chromatic edges similar/different than encoding of luminance edges.
The collection of files in this directory is related to the analysis of spatial receptive field structure of primate V1 cells. 
Throughout the files, I use white noise analysis, SVD, model fitting and model comparisons (like AIC, BIC, Cross-validation) to analyze the neuronal data.
